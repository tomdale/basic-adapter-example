# Basic Adapter Example

This small Ember.js app demonstrates how to use the new BasicAdapter API
in Ember Data.

To run it, you'll need node installed on your computer. Then:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You should then be able to open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The small server implementation is in `server.js`. The Ember.js
application is in `public/js/app.js`.
